# The Blockduino Manifesto
Blockduino is just a board and software to control the operations of machines and other hardware connected to it, from a smart-contract in the Ethereum blockchain. But it has a very ambitious goal.

### Goal
Goal of the Blockduino project is to change the way hardware and products are designed, manufactured and sold. It is inspired by the tenets of the [circular economy](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy), for a better world with a sustainable use of natural resources, reduced waste and consumerism. It is self-evident to the perceptive mind that the current way of depleating natural resources to make products that are not designed to last or in most cases, even to be repaired or refurbished, cannot be sustained in the long-term.

### Selling performance not ownership
By enabling the exchange of value provided by a product using the blockchain, smart-contracts and crypto-currency in each product, Blockduino allows OEM, brands and individuals alike, to generate value and rebuild capital by selling the performance of their products, not their ownership. To pay for the use and performance of a product, end users transfer Ether to the product's wallet in the amount for the performance established in a smart-contract. 

### Advantages
The intricacies and the details behind securely implementing such a system in a public blockchain can be overwhelming and time consuming for most designers and even large product companies. By mitigating most of the hurdles to generate value from a product by selling its performance through a blockchain and a smart-contract, we expect designers and companies around the world to be using Blockduino to experiment and eventually embrace new business models for their products consistent with a circular economy.

### Blockduino and IoT
Blockduino is not an IoT platform and it does not require one. It may in fact give an opportunity to the IoT paradigm to deliver on its promises. Once extending the lifecycle of a product and reducing its failure rate has an economic incentive, like it does in a pay-per-use or pre-paid business model, collecting operational data of each product in the field is crucial for anaylizing failures, predict them and improve its design.

### Shifting priorities
The adoption of alternative business models to ownership, has enourmous consequences to the way a product is designed and maintained. Since the manufacturer or distributor owns the products in the field, it makes more sense to design products using the best possible materials to make them last longer, and also to provide for practical ways to repair and refubish their products. For instance by releasing service manuals in the public domain which will also spur a market for spare parts.

### Blockduino and Arduino
The Blockduino SDK provides high-level functions reminiscent of the way to write code for the Arduino board but the Blockduino is not a system compatible with the Arduino in any way. Other than operating remotely through a connection to the public Ethereum blockchain, the other relevant difference in terms of design, is the use in the Blockduino of a Trusted Execution Environment. This is to allow the high level of security and protection needed when dealing with a hardware wallet and for value transactions in a public blockchain. 

### Open source movement
Blockduino is an open-source project open to external contributions and we invite anyone who shares this goal to join us and to give us suggestions.
